DESCRIPTION

  You have 8 active conversation windows open.  You are drinking a delicious 
  <insert beverage of choice here>.  All of a sudden, you feel the impending
  tinkle urge.  You ignore it for a few minutes.  The urge grows as sounds of
  waterfalls are broadcasted on <insert sound medium here>.

  Pidgin-Shout to the rescue.  Instead of having to type "brb" on all of your
  conversation windows, you type "/shout brb" in one conversation window and
  the message is broadcasted to all active conversation windows.

  Or, imagine you want to call a buddy out on a dare he never manned up on.
  He's denying that he ever said anything about it. All you remember was
  something about drinking raw eggs. Pidgin-Grep to the rescue. All you 
  have to do is type /grep raw eggs and all conversation lines with "raw eggs"
  will show up in your conversation window.

  The gist of this package is to provide some lightweight commands for basic
  conversation commands in pidgin.
