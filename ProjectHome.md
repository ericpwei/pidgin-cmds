You have 8 active conversation windows open. You are drinking a delicious <insert beverage of choice here>. All of a sudden, you feel the impending tinkle urge. You ignore it for a few minutes. The urge grows as sounds of waterfalls are broadcasted on <insert sound medium here>.

Purple-Shout to the rescue. Instead of having to type "brb" on all of your conversation windows, you type "/shout brb" in one conversation window and the message is broadcasted to all active conversation windows.

Or, imagine you want to call a buddy out on a dare he never manned up on. He's denying that he ever said anything about it. All you remember was something about drinking raw eggs. Purple-Grep is what you need. All you have to do is type /grep raw eggs and all conversation lines with the proof will show up in your conversation window.

The gist of this package is to provide lightweight commands to extend conversation functionality in pidgin and finch.
